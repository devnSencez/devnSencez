  - " what's there to know more about me? " :

hobbies that I have is what I can add - I do love to sing , draw and I do love to play a lot, what's more is that I love making friends , so don't be afraid to come and interact with me ! c ★ h is always allowed when it comes to me :)).

Mostly though I tend to do other things , so i'm semi-afk most of the time , if that happens you can always whisper to interact with me so I don't miss out on what you say if you ever plan on interacting with me.

also i'm a proud kubz scouts fan, he's my dad frfr

  - " any ships or things I don't personally want to interact with " : 

Well for me , I like any ships , not the illegal ones, I don't tolerate with those . I'm a multishipper so anything you may ship of is something I can surely agree of. (again, not the illegal ones like proships or something). for my dni's ? well basic dni criteria really. And surely I discourage people who uses their opinionsa and make it as "facts".

Also, I don't mind if people be mean for fun, but being mindful about other's feelings about this should also be known.

that's it really . Anyways, if you ever see me, don't be afraid to come up to me and talk ! I'm not really good at making friends since I can't muster up the courage to socially talk to people (even if it's a pony game I still don't know how to make friends, sighs badly) .

thanks for reading
so sigma balls sighs.
