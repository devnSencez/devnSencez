Hello . my name is verin, though you can call me anything you'd like, inappropriate names though is not encouraged. I use they / he / she pronouns and I'm a filipino . I have many interests.

" what's there to know more about me? " :

hobbies that I have is what I can add - I do love to sing , draw and I do love to play a lot, what's more is that I love making friends , so don't be afraid to come and interact with me ! c â˜… h is always allowed when it comes to me :)).

Mostly though I tend to do other things , so i'm semi-afk most of the time , if that happens you can always whisper to interact with me so I don't miss out on what you say if you ever plan on interacting with me.

also i'm a proud kubz scouts fan, he's my dad frfr

that's it really . Anyways, if you ever see me, don't be afraid to come up to me and talk . I'm not really good at making friends since I can't muster up the courage to socially talk to people (even if it's a pony game I still don't know how to make friends, sighs badly)
